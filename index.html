          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Good formatting shows parent-child relationships by using indented tabs.</li>
          <li>A tag is shown within angle brackets (<_>)</li>
          <li>Semantic tags are ideal because they describe the element being used.</li>
          <li>HTML is case-sensitive with exception of the declaration of the doctype.</li>
          <li>Some elements must be separated by a space while others must substitute a space with hyphens or underscores.</li>
          <li>Attributes to tags help make tags more specific, such as defining content for screen readers.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space wanted around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space wanted around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS can be written in-line to HTML, in the header to set the page's formatting, or in a separate file linked to the HTML as an href</li>
          <li>class attribute: add style to a specific element or elements, not all elements</li>
          <li>external CSS file is called style.css and needs to be attached to the HTML file with link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" inside angle brackets in the HTML head</li>
          <li>colors can be chosen by writing a color name such as "blue" but can be more specifically defined with hexadecimal colors</li>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is referred to as JS, and the file extension is .js</li>
          <li>JS adds functionality to a page for when the User interacts with it, like filling out forms, clicking buttons, etc.</li>
          <li>JS has many built-in objects, which in turn, have many built-in methods to use without having to "reinvent the wheel"</li>
          <li>variable: a named container that allows storage of data in code</li>
          <li>var VariabeName: defines and names a variable. This is called "declaring" a variable.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>var category = ["item1", "item2", "item3"];: defines and names a variable and an array (or list) of values/objects assigned to the variable</li>
            </ul>
          <li>control flow: the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>When writing a webpage, connect HTML and JS with script src="./assets/script.js" within script angle bracket elements after the footer but still inside the body</li>
          <li>Chrome DevTools: shows developers on Chrome browser how JS works with the website being viewed</li>
              <ul>
                <li>right-click a webpage and select Inspect, and navigate to the Console tab</li>

          <li>loop: using a predictable pattern to cycle through data</li>
              <ul>
                <li>create a for loop</li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>loop starting point: declare a variable and give it a value, for example var x = 0;</li>
                    <li>set a condition: the loop will continue to run until the conditoin is no longer met, for example x < shapes.length;</li>
                    <li>allow the array to iterate over each listed item: x++ (it's a shortcut for x+1)</li>
                    <li>EXAMPLE: for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
                      // code block
