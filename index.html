          <li>Good formatting shows parent-child relationships by using indented tabs.</li>
          <li>A tag is shown within angle brackets (<_>)</li>
          <li>Semantic tags are ideal because they describe the element being used.</li>
          <li>HTML is case-sensitive with exception of the declaration of the doctype.</li>
          <li>Some elements must be separated by a space while others must substitute a space with hyphens or underscores.</li>
          <li>Attributes to tags help make tags more specific, such as defining content for screen readers.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space wanted around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space wanted around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS can be written in-line to HTML, in the header to set the page's formatting, or in a separate file linked to the HTML as an href</li>
          <li>class attribute: add style to a specific element or elements, not all elements</li>
          <li>external CSS file is called style.css and needs to be attached to the HTML file with link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" inside angle brackets in the HTML head</li>
          <li>colors can be chosen by writing a color name such as "blue" but can be more specifically defined with hexadecimal colors</li>
